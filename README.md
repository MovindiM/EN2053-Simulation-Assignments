# EN2053-Simulation-Assignments

Assignments submitted for EN2053-Communication Systems and Networks at the Department of Electronic and Telecomunication Engineering - University of Moratuwa

The parity check codes used for error detection in most data link control layers (DLCs) today are cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes. The parity check bits are called the CRC. Cyclic codes are special linear block codes with one extra property. In a cyclic code, if a codeword is cyclically shifted (rotated), the result is another codeword.

In this assignment we created a CRC code encoder and decoder function using Phython and studied the behavior of CRC.
